# Python for Mathematics

Welcome to my Python for Mathematics repository! My name is Yusuf Ahmed and i am a firs year mathematics student learning python.

What im learning:i am learning the fundamental programming topics, such as files, data types, functions, logic and loops.

Why? As time passes, the world becomes more data driven and dependant on technology and programming becomes an increasingly funadmental skill to possess.
Many maths problems could involve the inversion of matrices with dimensions in the thousands or involve using powers in the millions, such problems are beypnd the capability of a simple calculator making python all the more necessary.
